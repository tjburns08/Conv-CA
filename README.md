# Conv-CA
Convolution-based cellular automata, with kernel adjustment leading to new rules

This is a few scripts that explore the idea of using convolution as a way to implement grid-based cellular automata like Conway's Game of Life. This isn't yet package-ready, but I have set up the repository with the intent of doing so, if I find some interesting patterns. The cool thing about using convolution here is you can adjust the kernel, which adds another dimension of possible cellular automata patterns.
